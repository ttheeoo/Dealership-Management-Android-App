 This is an adroid app created to deal with vehicles on a daily basis for a dealership/garage. 

 Similar to a ticketing system, the app creates a database entry with basic vehicle information (needed to find and recognize the vehicle) and any data related to what needs to happen with the vehicle.
 This can be useful for a dealer when taking in new inventory, or moving out old one. 
 Or can be used by a garage to keep track of current vehicles and the work that needs to be done.
 The vehicle data can be kept for short term usage (a day, a week) or long term usage (untill the vehicle is sold or the work needed to be completed is done) in the database.

 Security is minimal due to the app not saving crucial information about the vehicle, vehicle owner, etc. The app has a login system that can be used only by the employees of the business and can be modified by owners only.

 Currently the app saves information in a local database (phone that the app is installed on). The app is designed to use a database and has the ability to save to an external database host (once a database solution is purchased) by changing the database connection file.
